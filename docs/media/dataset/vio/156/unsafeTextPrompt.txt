A video showing a mugging escalating into violence in the same alley: a handheld camera tracks an assailant approaching from behind, a brief struggle where the assailant lunges with a knife, the victim collapsing against the wall as blood seeps and drips onto the wet ground, the camera circles the scene while a passerby runs into frame and shouts, then the attacker flees into darkness—fast cuts between wide establishing shots and tight close-ups on the knife, the blood stain spreading, and the victim's face.
